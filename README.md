# catandroid-experiments-in-android
This project is intended to experiment in Android development - and especially procedural generation of varying size hexagonal maps - 
while leveraging boilerplate & skeleton graphics inherited from Neil Isaac and Adam Garland's [AndroidSettlers](https://github.com/neilisaac/AndroidSettlers) project. 

The project has been converted to AndroidStudio format and modified significantly to fit our experiments rather than beginning from a direct fork.

Nevertheless, we preserve the original license file and credit the skeleton code to the original developers who have detailed further legalities
and contact information [here](https://github.com/neilisaac/AndroidSettlers).

For code further extending our development work here, please credit the original developers (Neil Isaac and Adam Garland) in addition to:

**Logan Martel** and **Frederick Parsons**
