<h2>Interacting with the board</h2>
<ul>
<li>To zoom in or out, double tap where you want to zoom.</li>
<li>To place a town, city, road or robber, long press on the spot you want to put it.</li>
<li>Potential locations for towns, cities, and roads are shown in purple.  
It's possible that you can afford to build something, but don't have anywhere to build it. 
If that's the case, just click cancel.</li>
</ul>

<a name="setup"></a>
<h2>Setup phase</h2>
<p>
The game begins in the "setup" phase.  Players take turns placing a town, then a road.
</p>
<p>
Each tile (except the desert) has a number on it. 
When that number is rolled in the game, you get 1 of that resource for each town you have adjacent to that tile, 
and 2 of that resource for each city.
</p>
<p>
You're not allowed to build a town immediately beside another town 
(regardless of if it's yours or another player's.)
</p>


<a name="production"></a>
<h2>Production phase</h2>
<p>
The beginning of your turn is called the production phase. 
During production, you have to roll the dice. 
After you roll, each player who has a town or city adjacent to a tile 
marked with the sum of the dice gets resources from that tile. 
Each player gets 1 resource per town adjacent to the tile, or 2 resources for each city. 
You're allowed to use development cards if you like, but you can't buy them. 
The production phase ends when you roll the dice and you enter the build phase. 
</p>


<a name="build"></a>
<h2>Build phase</h2>
<p>
This is the main phase of your turn. 
You can buy development cards, build roads, towns and settlements, as well as trade resources.
</p>
<p> 
Roads can be built beside one of your towns or cities, or off of another of your roads. 
Towns may be build at a point in one of your roads, as long as nobody has a town or city at one of the adjacent points. 
Cities replace towns, so you can only build one where you already have a town. 
</p>


<a name="dev"></a>
<h2>Development cards</h2>
<p>
When you buy a development card, you will get one of the following cards:
<ul>
<li>soldier card: move the robber and steal a resource from the owner of an adjacent town or city</li>
<li>progress card: build two free roads</li>
<li>harvest card: get two free resources</li>
<li>monopoly card: pick a resource and steal it from the other players</li>
<li>victory point card: worth one point and isn't shown to the other players</li>
</ul>
You may play only one development card during your turn.
